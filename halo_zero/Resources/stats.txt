The Usual:
This document is mine. Please don't rip it off or take credit for it. That
being said, feel free to post it on any site you want, provided you a) 
don't make any changes to it, and b) don't charge money for it. You 
don't even have to get my permission to post it (as long as it remains
unaltered), but it would be nice if you emailed me and let me know 
(joylock @ hotmail.com).

I spent several hours extracting the game data files, searching through them,
and compiling these statistics from them. If you take the information from
this document and use it in your own guide, web-site, or other work, you must
credit me with providing you with the in-game statistics. With that said, feel
free to distribute this information and this document as widely as you want,
as long as you do acknowledge me in the credits.



What's the Purpose of This Guide?

There are already some excellent, detailed FAQs on how to best use the
weapons in Halo, as well as the tactics, behavior, and methods of killing
the various enemies found in the game. The purpose of this guide is not
to provide detailed combat strategies for Halo. Instead, this guide is a
list of the in-game statistics of the game's weapons and characters, including
such information as health, armor, and weapon damage.

I recently was able to find this information thanks to the Halo Editing Kit
for the PC version of Halo: Combat Evolved. This information does not appear
to be published anywhere else on the internet, so I thought I would share
it with you here on Gamefaqs.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS:

I would like to thank the following people, without whom I could not have
browsed through Halo's game code and compiled the statistics used in this
guide.

- The people behind Halo Custom Edition and the Halo Editing Kit, from
  which I was able to acquire the game's statistical information.

- SteelIXB and his Halo Editing Kit Plus, for providing an easy way to
  read the single-player character files.

- Halopedia (halo.wikia.com) for providing the proper names and ammo types
  for the game's weapons.
